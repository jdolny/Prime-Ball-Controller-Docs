# Zones Overview

Zones are an integral part of the ball controller that allow you to change player controls and camera options depending on where the player is located.  It is how the sidescroll, overhead, and stationary zones
of the demo scene were created.  The zones are very easy to setup and you don't need to change the camera if you don't want to.  Perhaps you just want to change the controls in a certain area but keep the standard camera.  It
is very flexible.
