# Mobile Virtual Controller

As of version 1.3.0 a virtual mobile controller is now included with Prime Ball Controller.  By default this feature is disabled.

To enable the virtual controller:

Locate the Virtual Mobile Controller game object inside the Player game object and enable it in the Unity inspector.  That's it.

To test the controller with a keyboard and mouse in the Unity Editor you need to enable **Simulate Touch Input From Mouse Or Pen**.  This is found in Window->Analysis->Input Debugger.  Then select options and enable the **Simulate Touch Input From Mouse Or Pen**.
