# Basic Installation Directions

1.  Import the Prime Ball Controller Package
2.  If prompted to install dependencies, select **Install / Upgrade**, this will automatically install Cinemachine and the Input System for you. 
3.  Drag the **Player** prefab into your scene.  The prefab is located at **Assets->MagaericSolutions->Prime Ball Controller->Prefabs**.
4.  If your scene already has a Main Camera, remove or disable it.  The prefab has all of the needed cameras included with it.  If your project is already using Cinemachine and you need to keep your existing Main Camera / Cinemachine Brain, 
[follow these steps](../installation-previous-cinemachine).

That's it for the installation.  Happy rolling!  If you need more help, use the Detailed setup guide.
Your Prime Ball Controller in now ready to use.  Check the [Input Mapping Page](../../controller_options/input-mapping) for the default controls and directions to change them.
