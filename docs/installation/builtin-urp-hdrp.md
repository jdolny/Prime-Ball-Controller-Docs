# Using Different Render Pipelines (Built-In, URP, HDRP)

The Prefab that comes by default was made for the Built-In render pipeline.  If you need to use URP or HDRP just import the unity package located in the Prefab folder that corresponds to your render pipeline.  When importing, leave all checked boxes
as is.  This will overwrite the built-in materials with the correct materials for your pipeline.<br/>
