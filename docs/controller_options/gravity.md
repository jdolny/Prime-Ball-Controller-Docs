#Gravity

- **Grounded Force** - The force of gravity when the player is grounded
- **Initial Force** - The force of gravity when the player first becomes ungrounded, before the increment amount has applied
- **Max Force** - The maximum gravity force that can be applied
- **Max Player Fall Velocity** - The maximum negative vertical velocity that can be applied to the player, to set a limit on how fast the player can fall
- **Max Player Y Pos Velocity** - The maximum positive vertical velocity that can be applied to the player, to set a limit on how fast the player can go up
- **Increment Amount** - The amount of additional gravity force to add while player is falling until the max force is hit
- **Grapple Jump Initial Force** - The force of gravity when the player first releases from a grapple swing
- **Grapple Jump Max Force** - The maximum gravity force that can be applied while released from a grapple swing
- **Grapple Jump Increment Amount** - The amount of additional gravity force to add while player is falling from a grapple swing release until the max force is hit
