#Input Mapping

Input mapping allows you to adjust the input controls for the sphere.  The default values should allow both a Gamepad and Mouse / Keyboard to work by default.  Prime Ball Controller currently uses the old input system but can easily be changed to the new input
system by modifying the **Input Manager** script.  The default controls are:

**Move** - WASD

**Jump** - Space

**Magnet Climb** - Hold Right Mouse Button

**Sprint** - Hold Left Mouse Button

**Boost** - Hold Middle Mouse To Charge, Release To Boost

**Rotate Camera** - Hold Left Mouse Button, While Stationary and Move Mouse

**Free Look / FPS Camera** - Hold Right Mouse Button, While Stationary and Move Mouse

The **Rotate Camera** and **Free Look Camera** buttons are by default shared with **Sprint** and **Magnet** buttons.  Ideally these should be seperate buttons, but was included this way with the prefab to make things simple.
