The Cinemachine Cameras data repository defines which cameras are assigned to the Prime Ball Controller's available camera types.  These settings should rarely need changed from their defaults.

- **Magnet Camera** - The camera that is used when in magnet mode.
- **Magnet Ceiling Camera** - The camera that is used when in magnet mode and hanging from the ceiling.
- **Stationary Camera** - A stationary camera that can be assigned to camera zones.
- **Zoom Camera** - A zoom camera that can be assigned to camera zones.
- **Overhead Camera** - An overhead camera that can be assigned to camera zones.
- **First Person Camera** - A first person camera that can be used for freelook while holding the right mouse button.
- **Default Camera LookAt** - The default lookat object for the cameras, this is typically overridden anyway and rarely used, but still important.
