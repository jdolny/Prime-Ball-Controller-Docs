# Controller Options Overview

The options to control the sphere are all located within a single location to make it easier to find what you need to change, no need to hop around to different scripts looking for settings to change.  They can all be found on the Pbc Manager script component
 that is attached to the PlayerSphere object, under Data Repository.<br/>
