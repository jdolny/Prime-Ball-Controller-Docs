- **Coyote Time** - The time to still be able to jump when not grounded from a platform
- **Allow Jump Above Max Slope** - Enable / Disable jumping when on a slope greater than the current control's max slope angle
- **Jump Ceiling Force Reduction** - When a player jumps and hits the ceiling, the forces that are created in the opposite direction are high, enable this to reduce force
- **Ceiling Hit Reduction Multiplier** - If Jump Ceiling Force Reduction is enabled, this is the amount to reduce force by
- **Slope Jump Mode** - When the player is on a slope, should the jump go in the current player direction or away from the slope
