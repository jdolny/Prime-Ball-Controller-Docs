#Sphere Abilities

These settings control the abilities of the sphere, including sprint, jump, boost, and magnet.

- **Sprint Multiplier** - The amount the current force should be multiplied by when sprinting
- **Sprint Enabled** - Enable / Disable the sprint ability
- **Ball Jump Force** - The jump force when the control mode is Ball.
- **Wheel Jump Force** - The jump force when the control mode is Wheel
- **Ball Slope Jump Force** - The jump force when on a slope and slope jump mode is set to away from slope and the control mode is Ball
- **Wheel Slope Jump Force** - The jump force when on a slope and slope jump mode is set to away from slope and the control mode is Wheel
- **Allow Jump Above Max Slope** - Enable / Disable jumping when on a slope greater than the current control's max slope angle
- **Jump Ceiling Force Reduction** - When a player jumps and hits the ceiling, the forces that are created in the opposite direction are high, enable this to reduce force
- **Jump Enabled** - Enable / Disable jump ability
- **Slope Jump Mode** - When the player is on a slope, should the jump go in the current player direction or away from the slope
- **Magnet Climb Force** - Magnet mode climbing force.  This value is relational with magnet power.  If this value is too high and the magnet power is too low, the player will not stick to the wall when going around corners.
- **Max Climb Angle** - The max angle that can be climbed while in magnet mode
- **Min Ceiling Angle** - The minimum angle to be considered hanging from ceiling when in magnet mode
- **Magnet Power** - The strength of the magnet to keep the player attached to the wall.  This setting is relational to magnet climb force
- **Magnet Layer** - The layers that magnet mode can be activated on
- **Magnet Enabled** - Enable / Disable Magnet ability
- **Magnet Jump Enabled** - Enable / Disable jumping away from wall / ceiling in magnet mode
- **Magnet Jump Force** - The jump force applied when in magnet mode if magnet jump is enabled
- **Boost Multiplier** - The amount of boost to add when fully charged and released
- **Time To Full Charge** - The time in seconds to fully charge a boost
- **Boost Enabled** - Enable / Disable Boost ability
