#Mesh Rotation

These settings control the appearance of how the ball is rotating.  This does not effect movement.

- **Radius** - The radius used when calculating how fast the sphere will appear to spin.  A higher radius will make the ball appear to rotate slower
- **Wheel Lean Amount** - The amount to lean the mesh when turning in wheel mode
- **Orientation Correction Increment** - The amount to fix the wheel orientation transition with each fixed update
- **Orientation Correction Start** - The degree of where to starting when showing the orientation transition to wheel
