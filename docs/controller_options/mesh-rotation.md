#Mesh

These settings control the appearance of how the ball is rotating.  This does not effect movement.

- **Radius** - The radius used when calculating how fast the sphere will appear to spin.  A higher radius will make the ball appear to rotate slower
- **Wheel Lean Amount** - The amount to lean the mesh when turning in wheel mode
- **Orientation Correction Increment** - When switching from ball to wheel, this is the amount to fix the wheel orientation transition with each fixed update, which gives the animation effect of the transition
- **Orientation Correction Start** - The degree of where to starting when showing the orientation transition to wheel
- **FadeMaterial** - The material to apply to the sphere to make it transparent when too close to the camera
- **MinimumFadeDistance** - The minimum distance b/w the camera and the sphere where the sphere will become transparent
