The idea for this controller began with a personal project to try and create a Metroid Prime styled game. The first mechanic I wanted to implement was the ball. I figured I would just hop over to the asset store and purchase something that seemed to fit my project. After realizing there wasn't anything that was even close to what I wanted, I decided to create it myself. After I finished the controller, I wanted to make it available to others to hopefully inspire similar games. It's not perfect but accomplishes the goals I set for it. The controller works great for for a wide variety of 3d genres such as puzzle, sidescroller, fps / 3rd person, adventure, etc. It was designed to be very simple to use but with a vast array of options to customize it to your liking.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Download from the Unity Asset Store Playable WebGL Demo Welcome to the official documentation and demo site for the Prime Ball Controller, built with the Unity game engine.
